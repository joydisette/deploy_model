# Hello there! 

Welcome to my model zoo! Ever heard about Llamas? I knew I liked them after watching *Kuzco l'empreur megalo* when I was a kid. Last summer, I was riding along the route verte bike path from Granby to Montreal, and thaught I saw a llama!!!! Well no, apparently llamas get very often confused with another cute creature called Apalcas.
Not anymore! My model will check for you, and tell you if the picture is a llama or an apalca. Try it out by clicking the *launch on binder* icon at the top of this file. 

But in all seriousness, this is really me trying to deploy a notebook on binder with voila, and it is taking me an embarassing amount of time...
