# ðŸ¦™ Can you tell a LLama from an Alpaca?

I knew I liked Llamas *Kuzco l'empreur megalo* when I was a kid. Last summer, I was riding along the route verte bike path from Granby to Montreal, and thaught I saw a llama ðŸ˜² Well no, apparently llamas get very often confused with another cute creature called Apalcas...
Not anymore! My model will check for you, and tell you if the picture is a llama or an apalca. Try it out by clicking the *launch on binder* icon at the top of this file. 

Really, this is just me trying to deploy a notebook on binder with voila, and it is taking me an embarassing amount of time...

Update: 2 weeks later, I figured that all isues came from my requirements.txt file... Yo ucan now see the launch on binder icon, AND it should work properly. Stay tuned for other models. They might even be usefulðŸ˜Ž
